# AuthenticationPage

This project provides a basic user authentication system.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sunnygupta933/Authentication-Page.git
    cd AuthenticationPage
    ```

2.  **Install Composer (if not already installed):**
    If you encounter an error like "composer: The term 'composer' is not recognized...", it means Composer is not installed on your system or is not added to your system's PATH environment variable.

    You need to install Composer globally on your Windows machine first. Please refer to the official Composer installation guide by searching for "Composer installation Windows" on your preferred search engine (look for the `getcomposer.org` website).

    After you have successfully installed Composer, you can then proceed to the next step.

3.  **Install PHP Dependencies:**
    This project uses Composer to manage its PHP dependencies, including `phpdotenv` and PHPMailer. These dependencies are crucial for features like environment variable loading and email functionalities.

    To install them, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
    This command will download and install the necessary PHP dependencies, create the `vendor` directory, and generate the `autoload.php` file. This resolves potential "Failed opening required ... /vendor/autoload.php" errors, ensuring your application can load required classes.

4.  **Database Configuration:**
    *   Ensure you have a MySQL or compatible database set up.
    *   **Configure Database Credentials in `.env` file:**
        *   Open the `.env` file in the root directory.
        *   Update the following lines with your database connection details:
            ```
            DB_HOST="localhost"
            DB_USER="root"
            DB_PASS=""
            DB_NAME="authentication_page"
            ```

5.  **PHPMailer Setup:**
    *   This project uses PHPMailer for sending emails (e.g., for password reset, email verification).
    *   You will need to configure your SMTP settings. **Do NOT hardcode your email credentials directly into the code.**

    **Configuring SMTP Credentials:**
    To configure your SMTP email and password, please follow these steps:
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project (`AuthenticationPage/`).
    *   Add the following lines to your `.env` file, replacing `your_smtp_email@example.com` and `your_smtp_password` with your actual SMTP credentials:
        ```
        SMTP_EMAIL="your_smtp_email@example.com"
        SMTP_PASSWORD="your_smtp_password"
        ```
    *   The code will read these values from the environment variables.

    **Files requiring SMTP configuration (email and password placeholders):**
    *   `forgot_password.php`: Lines 58, 59, 62
    *   `signup.php`: Lines 93, 94, 98
    *   `reset_password.php`: Lines 78, 79, 82
